## Arapahoe Basin

A Basin opened for skiing on 17 October. I have since been up a couple of days to clear the cobwebs for a great ski season. So far just one blue run has been open. But it has been fun to get up, shake out the legs, and get eyes on some of the lines I can't wait to ski once there is more snow.
