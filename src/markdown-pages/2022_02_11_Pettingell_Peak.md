## I-70 North Skiing

There are multiple great skiing zones along I-70 just before the Loveland Ski Area and the Eisenhower Tunnel. They include the peaks and zones accessible from Watrous Gulch, Hermann Gulch, Dry Gulch and on Mount Trelease. During winter when snow instability is high, Watrous Gulch and lower Mount Trelease are two great, safe, accesible touring zones. If traffice isn't bad it only takes a bit more than an hour to get to the Watrous Gulch trailhead from Boulder, and it isn't a super popular zone unlike Berthoud or Loveland Pass.

Once Spring brings some upslope storms and the warmer temps start to build cohesiveness in the snowpack, this area starts to really shine. It has many great lines all accessed from two very easy to get to parking lots. I took the picture below the other day of this area from Loveland Pass. In it you can see (from left to right) Mount Trelease, The Citadel (very distinvtive peak), Pettingell Peak, and then Mount Bethel on the far right. On Mount Bethel you can see two fences which are used to stop snow from wind loading into a gully farther right that has the potential to avalanche down to I-70.

## Pettingell Peak

One goal for Sierra and I for this upcoming season is to ski Pettingell Peak. Its really a mellow ski line, but it still has significant avalanche danger and will take a long day of effort to ski. In order to manage the avalanche risk, we will have to wait until spring to ski it, in order for the melt-thaw cycle to build a cohesive snowpack. Realistically it won't have enough snow cover until we get a few of the sprintime upslope storms anyway. You can see the ascent line below, which would double as the ski/descent line.

I will update this with a trip report after we ski it!
